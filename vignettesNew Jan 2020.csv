1,,Out of date condom,"""nameBank1 and nameBank2  relationship has had its ups and downs. <br> Soon they are going to purchase a flat in the countryside. <br> Normally they always use a condom, but last night nameBank1 couldn't find a condom and nameBank2 forgot to pick them up. <br>  The local shop didn't have any. nameBank1 said, ""It's okay we don't need to use one anyway."" nameBank2 disagreed and insisted that if they don't have a condom, there will be no sex. ","Angry, nameBank1 rolled their eyes and said, ""Well maybe we shouldn't ever wear a condom. Who cares what happens."" And refused to have sex with nameBank2. ",namBank1 then proposed they go to their close friends next door to ask to borrow a condom.,nameBank1 stopped and told nameBank2 to wait and they would be right back to get condoms from the store. ,"1. Why not just delete the part about old condoms? They went to look, someone forgot to buy, they didn't have any. One said just don't worry, we'll be fine, the other said no.
2. Again, who uses a condom every time after being together for 3 years? Is the time frame critical? For realisms's sake, I suggest shortening this to less than a year or removing reference to specific time alltogether.","1. Dom would want to have sex anyway, so would condemn the person who wants to be safe.
2. Leadership would go themselves (or suggest they both go together) to get one - take charge of the group, etc.
3. Prestige would offer to go looking, I think. "
2,,Added third person to the relationship,"""nameBank1 and nameBank2 have been dating and living together for the past six years. <br> After those six years they began to feel that the relationship was becoming stale so they discussed introducing a third person into the mix. <br> They both agreed to choose the person that they both were comfortable with. <br> After nameBank3 was added to the relationship, nameBank2 became jealous of how much closer nameBank1 and nameBank3 had become.","Angry, nameBank2 walked up to nameBank2 and nameBank3 to talk. While staring directly in nameBank1's eyes, he began to kiss nameBank3 while pushing nameBank1 away. ",nameBank2 sat both of them down and discussed how they were feeling. Opening up the discussion they all agreed to spend more time as a group  and learning more about each other. ,"During the anniversary weekend between nameBank1 and nameBank2, nameBank2 asked nameBank1 to show them that they value their relationship together more than with nameBank3.","1. Edit: after x joined the relationship, B felt excluded more and more and became increasingly jealous of the apparent closeness between A & X.","1. Dom would approve of action described.
2. Leadership would approve.
3. Prestige is about being valued and respected, so this doesn't quite work - demanding this is more a dominance move. Maybe something like suggesting that A & B have an anniversary weekend without X? Essentially asking A to prove that B is more valued than X?"
3,,One night stand and contracting Chlamydia,"nameBank1 and nameBank2 have been dating for 1 year. Three weeks ago, they both signed a one-year lease on a flat in the center of town. nameBank1 had a one-night stand with an acquaintance, nameBank3. nameBank1 apologized a week later, and nameBank2 accepted the apology. ","However, nameBank2 was still hurt and had a one night stand with a stranger. Coming home later saying they are even now.",nameBank2 then said that things are over and was leaving. Eventually everyone agreed and parted ways. ,nameBank2 decided that they both should go to a counselor to discuss ways to deal with the affair.,"1. Name references don't match in core scenario…
2. Is the std needed? Why not just have the affair discovered?","1. Dom - Unclear that sleeping with the landlord is transactional... why mix financial and sexual betrayal? Why not just have them do a one night stand and tell the other person that they're now even?
2. Lead is ok, but doesn't need to be discussion… Could just say - it's over and we're parting ways, no betrayal.
3. This isn't prestige related. Hard to say what a prestige person would do here - maybe make htem make it up to them somehow?"
4,,Married 10 years one night stand,"""nameBank1 and nameBank2 have been married for 10 years. Now financially stable, both agreed to start a family. Soon they found out they were going to have a child together. However,  nameBank2 found out that nameBank1 had a one-night stand recently with an acquaintance, nameBank3, and got Chlamydia. ",nameBank2 drove over to nameBank3's house with nameBank1 and said you are going to say it was a mistake and will never happen again. ,nameBank2 sat down with nameBank1 and dicussed the problem that they have been having in their relationship. Eventually they decided to see a sex therapist to understand the qualms they have been having. ,,"1. If std is core here, ok, but otherwise, why include it?","1. Dom - would probably not do this. Would more likely break off the marriage or refuse to have kids.
2. Lead - Would probably tell the other person that they had to see a therapist with them (sexual therapist isn't the correct choice here; change to marriage counsellor).
3. Presige is hard. Would probably refuse to have children unless it was made up to them somehow (i.e. prove I'm special). But this is repetitive with one of the previous scenarios. Might tell some of the family to get sympathy, support, & be seen as the wronged party?"
5,,"Couple 3 years, new house, and affair","""nameBank1 had been dating nameBank2 for 3 years. They had just rented a new house in the suburbs, adopted a new dog, and were just married. nameBank2 found out that nameBank1 having an ongoing affair with a coworker after finding illicit text messages. ",nameBank2 the next day posted all of the messages on the board at work. Exposing the affair and causing havic at the office. ,nameBank2 contacted a divorce attorney and had papers served to nameBank1 ending the marriage.,nameBank2 quickly left with all their things to go stay with some friends while they think of ways to repair the relationship.,"1. dom is ok.
2. lead - would likely just contact a divorce attourney and have the papers served without discussion.
3. Pres might move back with old friends or family and see what the other person did to try to repair things (apology, therapy, etc).",
6,,Sixteen year old and sex before marriage,"""nameBank1 just turned sixteen. nameBank1's parents always insisted that nameBank1 wait until marriage to have sex, often telling stories of the danger of STDs. In nameBank1's mind it is her body and she can do what she wants. nameBank1's parents soon found out that she already had sex and grounded her for 3-months. ",nameBank1 retaliated by going out and having risky sex someone older than them that she didn't know.,nameBank1 then confronted them by saying that her/his brother nameBank2 had sex years before they did and was never in trouble. ,nameBank1 discussed with their parents that when they turn 18 years old they will decide for themselves if they should be sexually active. nameBank2 argued that they are an adult and can have safe sex when they want and should be respected as an adult. ,"1. 'until' marriage
2. grammar - tenses don't match - some past tense some present.
3. Dom - why multiple partners? Why not just sex with someone they didn't really know at a party? That's risky, no?","1. Lead - would state that they're an adult and can make decisions even if the parents don't agree. Possible point out that parents can't stop them, it's already done, they'll still decide what to do for themselves (i.e. assert leadership & authority).
2. Pres seems similar to me here - would likely argue that they'd been safe, etc., and should be respected as an adult, etc."
7,,Teenager pressuring pressuring partner to have sex,""""" + nameBank1[8] + "" and "" + nameBank2[8] + "" are both teenagers going to the same school. Their relationship has slowly been progressing but they still have not had sex. Impatient, "" + nameBank1[8] + "" would try everyday for "" + nameBank2[8] + "" to sleep with him. """,nameBank1  spread a rumor that the sex was horrible and not worth it. ,nameBank1 sat down with nameBank2 and proposed that they stop seeing each other until they are both ready to have sex and set boundaries on what is and isn't allowed in the relationship.,nameBank1 apologized for their behavior and said that they are more than happy to wait until she is ready. ,1. 'Their' relationship.,"1. Dom - who would ever spread a rumour that they, themselves, had been given an incurable STI?!?! Also, would probably say either that they'd already slept with them and it was rubbish or that they're a frigid bitch and not worth it.
2. Lead - Possible - maybe set hard boundaries about what behaviours are allowed?
3. Possible. Likely wouldn't have pressured her in the first place, but rather bragged about not pressuring her.

8,,Deliberate poking of condom.,""""" + nameBank1[9] + "" all his life has been told that he is smart, handsome, funny, and a great guy. Those that get to know him though say that he is very selfish. He only cares about himself. For 3-years he's been dating "" + nameBank2[9] + "". They would often muse the idea of having kids at some point in the future. However, "" + nameBank2[9] + "" says she's not ready at this moment. "" nameBank1[9] decided every time they would have sex he would poke a hole in the condom. Soon nameBank2 discovered she was pregnant. The next time they were going to have sex, nameBank2 walked in on nameBank1 poking a hole in the condom. ","nameBank2 was very angry at nameBank1 for poking holes in the condoms. She mused the idea of contacting an attorney to see what course of action she could take, including contacting the police. <br>Was "" + nameBank2[7] + "" justified for calling the police?"" ",nameBank2 proposed that nameBank1 quit school and get a job to contribute to the raising of the baby.,"After finding out she was pregnant<br> "" + nameBank2[7] + "" confronted nameBank1[9] + discussed what happened. They both talked it over and decided it was time for them to have a child together.  ","1. …muse 'about' or 'on' the idea of…
2. This one needs work… How would she know that he did this if it was without her knowing? Why report to the police instead of leaving him? It's not a crime, I don't think. Why is this a slight against  him? I don’t follow that on the psychological level.",
