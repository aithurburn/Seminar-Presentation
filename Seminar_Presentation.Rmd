# Risky behaviors

- Health behaviors are listed as of the lower risked areas.

- Why then is sexually risky behavior so common?

--

- What are the precursors?

--

- What are the co-morbid behaviors?

--

- Why are risk behaviors so common?

--

- Why are behaviors that are considered taboo still prevalent?

--

- What influences people to engage in risky behavior

  - Does dominance, prestige, and/or leadership predict risk?

# Exploratory Experiment 1

The present exploratory study sought to investigate the interaction between spiteful behavior and level of justification of spiteful acts. Endorsements of spiteful acts tends to suggest the propensity to be more spiteful. Early investigations of spiteful behavior was limited to non-sexual mundane tasks such as going to the grocery store or taking an exam in school. This exploratory study sought to expand the spitefulness literature to include sexual behaviors such as revenge sexual activity and the influence of power differentials.

# Moral Judgement

- An area of psychology bridging philosophical thought and psychology study.

- Separated in deontological and utilitarian judgements

  - Deontological: Moral judgements based on the right or wrong nature of the action based on the letter to the law.
  
  - Utilitarian: Moral judgements based on the results of the action being done regardless of the law or the morality of the action. 
  
- Moral judgement research often involves using situational dilemmas, most famous being the trolley dilemma. 
  - There is a runaway trolley barrelling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:

      1. Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.
      2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.
      
    - Which is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do?

# Experiment 1: Dilemmas

- Created a mix of sexual and non-sexual dilemmas

- Sexual vignettes focused around mainly three areas of sexual risk taking behaviors.

  - Condom use
  
  - Sexually transmitted infections
  
  - Revenge sex
  
- Non-sexual vignettes focused around common life events
  
  - Grocery shopping
  
  - Driving
  
  - Child custody

# Experiment 1: Vignette Example


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(Vignettes_df[1, 'Vign.8'], col.names = NULL)

```

All the vignettes have a common thread of spiteful reactions to certain behavior patterns and causes. However, some like the above, are devoid of sexual activity and are therefore a representation of the other four vignettes that are non-sexual. The above average justification score was `r sprintf(mean(Vign.df$Vign_8), fmt='%#.2f')` 
</div>
<div style = "position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0;">

- Participants generally regarded most vignettes as not justified or having low justifiability. 

- As noted with the selection of vignette three in the left figure, most participants believed there was low justifiability with the actions. As evident by the clustering of the violin plot of vignette 3.

# Experiment 1: Summary

This first exploratory experiment sought to:

- Explore the connection of spitefulness and vindictive behavior justification. 

--
  
- Act as a foundation for future experiments and future viability. 

  - Further investigation of power desires
  
  - Future investigation of influence of image manipulation
      
      - Visual stimuli

# Vignette Change Example:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
newVignettes[] <- lapply(newVignettes, gsub, pattern = '√Ç', replacement = " ")
kable(newVignettes,"html", col.names = c("Vignette Number", "Base Text", "Dominance", "Leadership", "Prestige"), booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 13, full_width = FALSE)


```

- There were a number of changes that I did with the styles of the vignettes:

  - Randomizing the base text of the vignettes
  
  - Randomizing the ending conflict "resolution" based on three outcomes based in power desire research 
      
      - Dominance, prestige, or leadership
  
  - Focusing just on sexual risk decisions
      
      - Future studies branching out into multiple risk domains
      
---

# Experiment 2

- In future studies I want to expand out from sexual risk to other domains such as recreational risk and so forth.

- Investigating the influence of visual and audio manipulation and its influence on power desires and risk.
